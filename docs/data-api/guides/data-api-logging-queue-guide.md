> **Status**: üöß In Development  
> **Availability**: Not available for testing or production use

‚ö†Ô∏è **This logging queue mechanism is currently in development and is NOT available for use. This documentation is provided for planning and preview purposes only.**

## Overview

This guide explains how to create/update an event on the Partner API and define credit type and priority for logging **when this feature becomes available**.

There are two ways to create an event and define the credit type and priority on the Partner API:

- **Tenant level** ‚Äì POST /events
- **Club level** ‚Äì POST /clubs/id/events

In addition, there's one method available to update an event and modify its credit type and priority:

- PUT /events/{id}

## Common Steps

### 1. Login to PAPI

Authenticate to access PAPI endpoints.

**API Endpoint:**

```
POST https://api.pixellot.tv/v1/login
```

**body:**

```json
{
  "username": "string",
  "password": "string"
}
```

**Response Example:**

```json
{
    "token": "[your_api_token]",
    "expiry": 545454545
}
```

## Event creation via Club-level API

**API Endpoint:**

```
POST https://api.pixellot.tv/v1/clubs/{clubId}/events
```

Replace {clubId} with your actual club ID.

**Headers:**

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_api_token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Replace {your_api_token} with your actual API token.

**Request Example:**

```
POST /clubs/id/events
{
    "eventName": "Event Name",
    "start$date": "2024-11-01T01:00:00.000Z",
    "end$date": "2024-11-01T01:03:00.000Z",
    "venue": {
        "_id": "{venueId}"
    },
    "scoreboardData": {
      "homeTeam": "[your_team_1]",
      "awayTeam": "[your_team_2]",
      "enable": true
    },
    "productionType": "[your_sport_type]",
    "permission": "admin",
    "breakdownDetails": {
       "type": "<basic|advanced>",
       "priority" : <1|2|3>
    }
}
```

The breakdownDetails object is optional. However, if provided, both the type and priority fields are required

## Event creation via Tenant-level API

**API Endpoint:**

```
POST https://api.pixellot.tv/v1/events
```

**Headers:**

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_api_token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Replace {your_api_token} with your actual API token.

**Request Example:**

```json
{
  "eventName": "Event Name",
  "start$date": "2024-11-01T01:00:00.000Z",
  "end$date": "2024-11-01T01:03:00.000Z",
  "status": "active",
  "venue": {
    "_id": "600e9106b4f21efbb2ba97fc"
  },
  tenant: "tenant_name",
  "permission": "admin",
  "scoreboardData": {
    "homeTeam": "Eagles",
    "awayTeam": "Tigers",
    "enable": true
  },
  "productionType": "basketball",
  "breakdownDetails": {
       "type": "<basic|advanced>",
       "priority" : <1|2|3>
  }
}
```

## Event update

**API Endpoint:**

```
POST https://api.pixellot.tv/v1/events/{eventId}
```

Replace {eventId} with your actual event ID.

**Headers:**

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_api_token}
Content-Type: application/json
```

Replace {your_api_token} with your actual API token.

**Request Example:**

```json
{
    "breakdownDetails": {
       "type": "<basic|advanced>",
       "priority" : <1|2|3>
  }
}
```

Updates to breakdownDetails will be blocked if the event has already been logged or is currently in the process of logging

## Key Notes
- Skip logging if breakdownDetails are missing and neither a team nor a league rule is specified.
- If an invalid type or priority is provided, the logging system will also fall back to default logging.
- Default logging settings are:  type: ‚Äúbasic‚Äú, priority: 2.
