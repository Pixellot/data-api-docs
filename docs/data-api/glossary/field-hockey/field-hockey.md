# Field Hockey Glossary

## Field Hockey TagEvents Resources and Attributes Glossary

### Introduction

This glossary documents all possible tagEvents resources and their attributes specific to Field Hockey tagging. It serves as a comprehensive reference for developers working with our Field Hockey tagging API, which uses a flow-based structure to track continuous game actions, transitions, and player movements throughout the match.

### Tagging Methodology

Our field hockey tagging system uses two main types of tag creation:

- **Running Tags**: Continuous tags that are turned on and off based on specific game conditions
- **Instant Tags**: Point-in-time tags that capture specific events with predefined durations

Each tag has specific lead times and durations:
- **Lead Time**: The amount of time BEFORE the logger's click that the tag event starts.
- **Duration**: How long the tag remains active (for instant tags) or whether it's continuous (for running tags).
