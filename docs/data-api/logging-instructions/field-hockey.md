- Set Play
- Free Hit
- Penalty Corner Lead Up
- Shootout

Each of these tags is explained in detail below (the letter in parentheses indicates the keyboard shortcut):



## Logging Tags

### PERIOD (P)

Tag each quarter of the match. Start the tag a few seconds before the quarter begins and keep it active until a few seconds after it ends.


### POSSESSION (Q)

Tag the team that has possession of the ball. As in most sports, possession changes when you double-press Q, after goals, injuries, or at the end of a quarter. Clear the possession tag at those moments.



### SHOT (1)

Tag all types of shots on goal. Shot types include:

- **Goal** – when a goal is scored
- **Save** – when the goalkeeper makes a save  
- **Wide** – when the shot misses the goal
- **Block** – when the shot is blocked by a defender



### SET PLAY (W)

Tag all types of set plays during the match. Types include:

- **Center Pass** – when play starts from midfield (at the beginning of halves or after goals)
- **Penalty Hit** – a penalty stroke taken from 7 meters
- **Hit In** – when the ball is played back into play from the sideline
- **Penalty (Short) Corner** – awarded to the attacking team when the defending team commits a foul (e.g., foot, body, or hand contact) inside their own 16-meter circle

- **Long Corner** – awarded when a save or block deflects the ball out of bounds, giving the attacking team a corner

### PENALTY (F)

Tag when a team commits a foul. Select the team that committed the foul. Common fouls include:

- Playing the ball with the foot or body
- Using the wrong side of the stick
- Pushing, holding, or other physical contact
- Dangerous play (e.g., high stick, playing the ball too close to another player)
- Obstructing an opponent with the body
- Not keeping the required 5-meter distance on a free hit

### OFFENSIVE ZONE (A)

Tag when the ball enters the final 25 meters of the field. It does not matter which team has possession — once the ball enters this zone, the tag is active. Turn off the tag once the ball exits the 25-meter area.

### OUTLET (D)

Tag when the defending team gains possession in their 25-meter defensive zone and begins an attempt to move the ball past midfield. The outlet ends if the team loses possession or crosses midfield.

Outlets can start from:
- A turnover
- A hit in
- A free hit within the defensive zone

### FREE HIT (H)

Tag a free hit, awarded for a minor foul that does not warrant a penalty corner or penalty stroke. Free hits are taken from the location of the foul unless it occurs within the defensive circle.

Free hits can be:
- **Passed** to another player
- **Self-started** (the player dribbles the ball themselves)

#### Free Hit Types:
- **16m Free Hit**
- **25m Free Hit**

Also tag whether it was **Successful** (team retained possession) or **Unsuccessful** (team lost possession).

### CIRCLE (R)

Tag when the ball enters the 16-meter circle and the attacking team is in possession. End the tag when:
- The ball exits the circle
- The attacking team loses possession within the circle

### PENALTY CORNER LEAD UP (L)

Tag the reason a penalty corner was awarded. This is used when the referee calls a penalty corner due to a defensive foul inside the attacking circle (16 meters). Tag the defensive team that committed the foul.

### SHOOTOUT

Tag only when penalty shootouts occur at the end of the match.

For each attempt:
- Tag **Successful** if the goal is scored
- Tag **Unsuccessful** if the attempt fails
- Also, tag the player taking the shot

Additionally, use the Shot tag to classify the outcome:
- Goal
- Save  
- Wide
